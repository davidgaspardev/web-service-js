# Web Service | RESTful

Web Service with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org), [RESTful API](https://restfulapi.net) and [Restify](http://restify.com).

## Node.JS

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/).

## RESTful API

REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.

Like any other architectural style, REST also does have it’s own [6 guiding constraints](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/) which must be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful.

## Restify

A Node.js web service framework optimized for building semantically correct *RESTful* web services ready for production use at scale. restify optimizes for introspection and performance, and is used in some of the largest Node.js deployments on Earth.
